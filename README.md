# Covid Graphs

A micro-site for showing the latest Covid Data in your area. All data is retrieved from the [UK Government Covid-19 API](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/developers-guide).

The site can be viewed [here](https://hexmod.github.io/covid-graphs/)

## Development

For local development, a web server is required. This can be achieved using Python 3 by running:
```python
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
```
The site is then accessible at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
